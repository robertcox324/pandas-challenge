Observable trends within the data for the Heroes of Pymoli assignment include:

1) There are many more male players (84.03%) than female/other combined. This is either
a game that attracts more male players to itself by some aspect of itself, or
this is simply a result of the fact that there is a larger male demographic that
plays games on the platform the game is released for. The latter is likely part of it
as most games platforms have higher male demographics, but it's not guaranteed to be the case

2) The main age demographic for this game is young adults ages 20-24,
making up nearly half the players (44.79%) and a large portion of the 
remaining players fall into the 5 year age ranges immediately before 
and after it

3) Nearly all of the top spenders also fall within this target demographic
The top 5 spenders are, in order, 25, 24, 22, 21, and 20 years of age.
not only is 20-24 and its immediate surrounding groups the top spenders by volume
it also has a relatively high average due to individuals like this

4) the top spenders only purchased at most 5 items each, so this game does not yet have
huge whales spending a ton on in-game purchases as many others with in-game purchases do, 
at least not in the data provided at the time
